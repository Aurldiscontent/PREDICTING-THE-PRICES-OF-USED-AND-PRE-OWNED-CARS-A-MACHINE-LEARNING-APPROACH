# Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
Car price prediction is a crucial area of research in machine learning, as vehicle prices depend on numerous factors. These include brand reputation, features, horsepower, mileage, year of manufacture, fuel type, and market trends. By analyzing historical car sales data, machine learning models can identify patterns and relationships between these factors to provide accurate price estimates. This helps potential buyers and sellers make informed decisions while ensuring fair market value.

This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. Advanced techniques like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks can further enhance prediction accuracy. By leveraging machine learning, this model provides a reliable way to estimate car prices, benefiting both consumers and businesses in the automotive industry.
